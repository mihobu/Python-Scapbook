It's official: kale is passe. That's according to the 2016 Canadian Chef survey conducted by BrandSpark International, which takes the pulse of the country's gastronomic trends. For the second year running, craft beers and microbrews clinch the top spot, followed by charcuterie and sauces such as sriracha and hoisin. Meanwhile kale and other leafy vegetables have withered down the rankings to number 10. "The Canadian culinary scene is unique and understated, much like Canada, says Donna Dooher, a chef and the president of Restaurants Canada, a nationwide association representing more than 30,000 hospitality establishments. "I predict we will see leafy greens drop further down and root vegetables native to Canada, such as squashes, make a comeback."
